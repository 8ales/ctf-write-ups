## What_did_he_said (Crypto, 300pt)

The challenge provided us a zip file and a pdf describing the challenge's scope. Extracting the files from the zip file we have an `encrypted.txt` file and two recovered public keys.

Hint: What we recovered were few public keys, and confession of few inmates tells us that they had crooked Jailerâ€™s machine to produce repetitive numbers.

`recovered_1.key`:
```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MCwwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADGwAwGAIRAMlciLTeSYml/7kmx5RUToUCAwEAAQ==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```
`recovered_2.key`:
```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MCwwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADGwAwGAIRAOeiuMWobft9fGsyIB23Q4sCAwEAAQ==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Taking into account the provided hint we tried to recover the private key using the RsaCtfTool. Executing the command ```./RsaCtfTool.py --publickey ./recovered_1.key --private``` we were able to obtain the private keys for both public keys provided. 

Thus, it's time to decrypt the encrypted file. Using the same tool we were able to decrypt the file as shown below:
```
RsaCtfTool.py --public recovered_2.key --verbose --uncipher encrypt.txt

So the flag is hackim18{'BabaSaidJaiJugad'}
